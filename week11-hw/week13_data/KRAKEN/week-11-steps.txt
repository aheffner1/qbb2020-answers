Homework: Analysis of metagenomic data

Step 1: Investigate the taxonomic profile of the reads

(1a) Parsing the kraken files - used a for loop in a bash script
	this turns takes the main column from the kraken files removes unwanted names such as root and semi-colons 
	and returns one file with the first column a count of uniq lines and it is tab delimited

	subl krona-input.sh

	#!/bin/bash

	for SAMPLE in 83 88 90 94 86 89 93 97 
	do 
	sed "s/SRR4921.*	/	day-${SAMPLE}	/g" SRR4921${SAMPLE}.kraken | sed 's/root;/	/g' | sed 's/organisms;/	/g' | sed 's/group;/	/g' | sed 's/;/	/g' >> all_samples_2.kraken
	done
	uniq -c all_samples_2.kraken > all_samples_c_2.kraken

	./krona-input.sh

Question 1: Briefly comment on the trends you see in the gut microbiota throughout the first week.
Enterococcus faecalis is the most prevalent species in all days
Other species that pop up through out the week are Staphylococcus epidermis, Cutibacterium avidum, Staphylococcus aureus 

(1b) Run Krona 
	
	ktImportText all_samples_c.kraken -o output-samples.html

	open output-samples.html

Step 2: Deconvolute the assembled scaffolds into individual genomes (binning)
	
(2a) Index the assembly
	bwa index assembly.fasta

(2b) Create bash script file to align all files to the assembly.fasta
	subl align.sh

	#!/bin/bash
	for SAMPLE in SRR492183 SRR492188 SRR492190 SRR492194 SRR492186 SRR492189 SRR492193 SRR492197 
	do
	bwa mem -R "@RG\tID:${SAMPLE}\tSM:${SAMPLE}" -o ${SAMPLE}.sam assembly.fasta READS/${SAMPLE}_1.fastq READS/${SAMPLE}_2.fastq
	done

	./align.sh

(2c) use metabat2 to bin the alignments hopefully into distinct genomes assemblies

	jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths --outputDepth depth.txt *.bam

	metabat2 -i assembly.fasta -a depth.txt -o bins_dir/bin

Question 2: What metrics in the contigs can we use to group them together?

Question 3:
(A) How many bins did you get?	 6 

(B) Roughly what percentage of the assembly do they represent? 
wc -c assembly.fasta = 38,000,000 wc bin(1-6).fa = 13,000,000 
13,000,000/38,000,000 = 34 %

(C) Do you think the sizes of each bin look about right, based on what you know about the size of prokaryotic genomes? 
Yes, the size of each bin is roughly 2 Mb (wc -c bin1.fa) this is similar to the E coli genome ~4.6Mb.

(D) How would you estimate how complete and how contaminated each bin is?
Once you find the likely species that the bin represents you can align your bin assembly to the real genome. This will give you how complete 
and contaminated the binning is. 

Step 3: Estimate the taxonomy of your putative genomes

(3a) Systematically take each node and grep in assembly.fasta

	#!/bin/bash

	for SAMPLE in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
	do 
	grep -e '>' bin.${SAMPLE}.fa | sed "s/>//g" > nodes.${SAMPLE}.txt

	while read line; do
	grep -e "$line" ../KRAKEN/assembly.kraken | cut -f 2 >> full-tax-${SAMPLE}.txt
	done < "nodes.${SAMPLE}.txt"

	uniq -c full-tax-${SAMPLE}.txt | sort -nrk 1 >> tax-${SAMPLE}.txt

	echo -n "bin.${SAMPLE}	" >> all-bin-top-hit.txt
	head -1 tax-${SAMPLE}.txt | cut -f 10 -d ';' >> all-bin-top-hit.txt

	done

Question 4:
(A) What are your predictions for each bin? 	
bin.1 Staphylococcus haemolyticus
bin.2 Leuconostoc citreum
bin.3 Staphylococcus lugdunensis
bin.4 Enterococcus faecalis
bin.5 Cutibacterium avidum
bin.6 Staphylococcus epidermidis
bin.7 Staphylococcus aureus
bin.8 Anaerococcus prevoti

(B) This approach to classification is fast, but not very quantitative. Propose one method to more robustly infer the taxonomy of a metagenomic bin.

Take each node sequence and do a blast search possibly? This would give you percentage idenity to the species, but only for that node. 

Step 4: Make a heatmap of the individual bin abundances over time

I made a Jupyter Notebook call week-11-heatmap.ipynb 

Question 5: Compare the results of the individual genome abundance analysis to the conclusions you derived from looking at the read taxonomy distributions (from Step 1). Do they agree with each other? What is different?

In general, the Krona map and the heatmap agree. However, there is much more noticable difference in the heatmap. 
The Enterococcus faecalis is still the most prevalent species in all days for the heatmap as it was in the krona map. 
It is much more noticable the increase and decrease in Cutibacterium avidum throughout the days using the heatmap.
